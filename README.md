# DevOps course | Task 4

You have been invited to the startup "AsciiArtify", which plans to develop a new software product for converting images into ascii-art using Machine Learning.
AsciiArtify was created by two young programmers with experience in software development and the desire to launch their own product, but no experience in DevOps.
The startup team prepares the concept of the project and chooses tools for the local development system, considering options based on Kubernetes â€” minikube, kind and k3d.
